Write a Python program to check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones of 
same length in a given string. Return True/False

Sample 1:
Original sequence: 01010101
Check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones in the said string:
True

Sample 2:
Original sequence: 00
Check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones in the said string:
False

Sample 3:
Original sequence: 000111000111
Check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones in the said string:
True

Sample 4:
Original sequence: 00011100011
Check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones in the said string:
False
