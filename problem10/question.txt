Write a Python program to find all the factors of a given natural number.

Factors:
The factors of a number are the numbers that divide into it exactly. The number 12 has six factors:
1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 If 12 is divided by any of the six factors then the answer will be a whole number. For example:
12 / 3 = 4

Sample 1:
Original Number: 1
Factors of the said number: {1}

Sample 2:
Original Number: 12
Factors of the said number: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}

Sample 3:
Original Number: 100
Factors of the said number: {1, 2, 4, 100, 5, 10, 50, 20, 25}
